This Dockerfile installs the ESP-IDF dependencies, installs the python3-venv package, clones the ESP-IDF repository, sets the environment variables, sets the working directory to /app, copies the project files into the container, and builds the project using idf.py.

# Prerequisites
1) install docker
It is recommended to install Docker using the convenience script. See the detailed instructions for the installation on the Docker website:
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script

    Tip: preview script steps before running

    You can run the script with the --dry-run option to learn what steps the script will run when invoked:

    $ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    $ sudo sh ./get-docker.sh --dry-run

    To install the script, after reviewing, run the script without the --dry-run option:
    $ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    $ sudo sh ./get-docker.sh

2) install git


To use this Dockerfile, create a new directory for your ESP32 project and copy the Dockerfile into it. Then, copy your project files into the same directory and run the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t esp32_plc_mock2 .

Replace esp32_plc_mock2 with the name you want to give your Docker image.

Once the Docker image is built, you can run the following command to start a new container and build your project:

docker run -it --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 -v $(pwd):/app esp32_plc_mock2

This command starts a new container with the esp32_plc_mock2 image, mounts the current directory ($(pwd)) as a volume inside the container, and sets the working directory to /app. You can then run idf.py commands inside the container to build and flash your project.
